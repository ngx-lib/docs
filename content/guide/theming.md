# Theming

Customizing the theme of a dropdown is one of the common use cases that we have observed. Multiselect currently supports two themes out of the box. These are
  1. *Bootstrap*
  2. *Material*

You can use `theme` property binding to pass on theme you want to apply. By default it sets to `material`, you can pass `bootstrap` value as well.
