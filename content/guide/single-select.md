# Single Select

Simply use multiselect dropdown as a single select by specifying `multiselect` property binding as `false`. Also by default it is set to `false`. Also you can hook up on different [events](https://ngx-lib.github.io/multiselect/guide/events) of the multiselect dropdown.

<div class="l-sub-section">
	For single select dropdown, the helper buttons such as *Select All*, *Select None* won't be shown because they are not required here.
</div>
